# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using a machine learning model. By utilizing the Titanic dataset, the project introduces fundamental concepts in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development.

## Dataset

The dataset includes detailed information about the passengers on the Titanic, such as:

- **PassengerId**: A unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Pclass**: Passenger ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- **Name**: The name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: The passenger's age.
- **SibSp**: The number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: The number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: The ticket number.
- **Fare**: The fare paid by the passenger.
- **Cabin**: The cabin number.
- **Embarked**: The port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
- **Survived**: Indicates survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes) [Target Variable].


## Key Steps

### Data Preprocessing:

- Handling missing data.
- Converting categorical features to numerical values.
- Normalizing and scaling the data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Examining the distribution of various features.
- Identifying correlations between features.
- Visualizing data through different plots.

### Feature Engineering:

- Creating new features (e.g., deriving family size from SibSp and Parch).
- Encoding categorical features.
- Selecting the most relevant features.

### Model Building:

- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Fine-tuning models through hyperparameter optimization.

### Model Evaluation:

- Comparing the performance of different models.
- Selecting the best-performing model.
- Making predictions on the test dataset.


## Results

The final model's effectiveness will be assessed by its ability to accurately predict passenger survival in the test dataset. Detailed results and visualizations are available in the notebooks.
